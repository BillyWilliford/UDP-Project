# UDP-Project
UDP Project done in Intro to Networks class at Auburn University

This is a project completed at Auburn University in which we had to implement a working UDP client server with a "Gremlin" on the client side that corrupted files with a probability entered by the user.

If you plan on running this code, make sure to change HOSTNAME in UDPClient to your computer's hostname. 
If you run the UDPClient and UDPServer on separate computers, make sure to change HOSTNAME in UDPClient to the hostname of the computer running UDPClient.
